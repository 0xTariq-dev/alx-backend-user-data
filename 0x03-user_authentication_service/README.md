## Tasks :white_check_mark:

+ [x] 0. **User model**
    + Create a SQLAlchemy model named User for a database table named users
    + The model must have the following attributes:
        + `id`, representing a column of type `Integer`, that can't be null and is a primary key
        + `email`, representing a column of type `String(250)`, that can't be null and must be unique
        + `hashed_password`, representing a column of type `String(250)` that can't be null
        + `session_id`, representing a column of type `String(250)` that can be null
        + `reset_token`, representing a column of type `String(250)` that can be null

+ [x] 1. **Create user**
    + In this task, you will complete the DB class provided below to implement the add_user method.

    + The method should save the user to the database and return the user object.

+ [x] 2. **Find user**
    + In this task, you will complete the DB class provided below to implement the find_user_by method.
