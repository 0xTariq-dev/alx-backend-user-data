## Tasks :white_check_mark:

+ [x] 0. **User model**
    + Create a SQLAlchemy model named User for a database table named users
    + The model must have the following attributes:
        + `id`, representing a column of type `Integer`, that can't be null and is a primary key
        + `email`, representing a column of type `String(250)`, that can't be null and must be unique
        + `hashed_password`, representing a column of type `String(250)` that can't be null
        + `session_id`, representing a column of type `String(250)` that can be null
        + `reset_token`, representing a column of type `String(250)` that can be null

+ [x] 1. **Create user**
    + In this task, you will complete the DB class provided below to implement the add_user method.
    + The method add_user takes mandatory email and hashed_password arguments.
    + The method should save the user to the database and return the user object.

+ [x] 2. **Find user**
    + In this task, you will complete the DB class provided below to implement the find_user_by method.
    + The method find_user_by takes a list of keyword arguments and returns the first row found in the users table as filtered by the methodâ€™s input arguments.
    + The method should return an instance of the User model.

+ [x] 3. **Update user**
    + In this task, you will complete the DB class provided below to implement the update_user method.
    + The method update_user takes two mandatory arguments: the first argument is the user_id and the second argument is a dictionary of the user attributes to update.
    + The method should return None.

+ [x] 4. **Hash password**
    + In this task, you will complete the hash_password function provided below to implement the _hash_password method.
    + The method _hash_password takes a string argument and returns a string of bytes.
    + The returned string is a salted hash of the input string, hashed with SHA256.

+ [x] 5. **Register user**
    + In this task, you will implement a register_user function that implements the following:
        + The function takes an email and a password as arguments.
        + The function should hash the password and save the user to the database.
        + if the email is already registered, the function should raise a `ValueError` with the message `User <email> already exists`.
